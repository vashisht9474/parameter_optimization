### Dataset
The dataset for the project has been downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Room+Occupancy+Estimation

This dataset is used for estimating the precise number of occupants in a room using multiple non-intrusive environmental sensors like temperature, light, sound, CO2 and PIR. It is a multi-variate classification Dataset.

Number of Instances: 10129

Number of Attributes: 16

### Conclusion

From the above graph, we can conclude that the model is well trained and parameter have been optimized due to the less gap between training and cross-validation curve.

The graph is made for the sample which has best accuracy. Sample 9 has the best accuracy of 0.97 having kernel = Poly, Nu = 1.27 and Epsilon = 6.87.
